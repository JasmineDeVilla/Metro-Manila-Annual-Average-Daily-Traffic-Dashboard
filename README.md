- Cars have the largest contribution to the volume of cars in the Metro Manila area on a daily basis.
- EDSA has the most traffic from 2012-2021.

Additional data aside from volume of vehicles would be beneficial to determine the causes aof traffic more accurately such as accidents, road damages, speed etc. that may contribute to traffic congestion.
